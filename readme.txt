 * Description:
 * The Kitten Grid 1.0 is a full dynamic, customizable css grid. Don't be stuck on a base width, margins, or
 * columns that are pre-defined by anyone. Adjust the grid style based on your needs! With only one short 
 * mixin in LessCss.
 *
 * If you want to know how to use the Grid, contact me or take a look at the demo (if it's not there yet, it will be 
 * available online soon!)
