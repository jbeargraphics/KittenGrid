 * Description:
 * The Kitten Grid 2.0 is different to the first version. It has dynamic width, but fixed margins.
 * The base classes are embedded once as soon as you use the Kitten Grid (no matter how much different versions of the
 * grid you are initializing). The Grid should work fine from IE8+ (not all tests are done yet!)
 *
 * If you want to know how to use the Grid, contact me or take a look at the demo (if it's not there yet, it will be 
 * available online soon!)
