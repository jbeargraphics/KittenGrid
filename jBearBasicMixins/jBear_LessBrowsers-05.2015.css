 *
 *
 * I started to create a browserhacksheet based on http://browserhacks.com > might be useful for cross browser hacks
 * (but usage should be avoided if possible)
 *
 * No Property/Value Hacks are added!
 *
 *
 * How To Use?
 * Select the BrowserHack that you need, choose a custom Css Selector (Only classes available for now),
 * write your Style into a dummy class / mixin class, add the file to your project.
 *
 * Example:
 * Selecting Firefox gt2 : @firefox2;
 * Css Selector: .MySelector;
 * Style: color: green;
 * Additional Style: the class ".mixin"
 *
 * How To write the Less File:
 * .mixin {
 *    background: red;
 * }
 * .BrowserSelect(@firefox2, MySelector, { color: green; .mixin } );
 *
 * OUTPUT:
 *
 * .mixin {
 *   background: red;
 * }
 * body:last-child .MySelector,
 * x:-moz-any-link {
 *   color: green;
 *   background: red;
 * }
 *
 * !!! IMPORTANT: DON'T Forget the curved brackets around the style!!!
