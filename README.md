# LessCssLibrary
It might be Less but still growing ;)





## What is/will be included?
1. A basic Css Reset (to be continued...)
2. Some basic LessCss Mixins to simplify the input of vendor-prefixed Css properties
3. Useful fallbacks for older Browsers
4. Mixins for usage in Projects (like Grid Systems, Alignments, etc.)

More Infos will follow soon!

Details about the single sub-projects (and how to use) can be found in the sub folders (will be added soon!).





## Any Questions? Feel free to contact me!
